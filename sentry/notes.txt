Texture is blank for now, will do it later,
4 bones:
Head, which goes from the middle and up.
Gun, self explanatory.
Muzzle, i attached the weapon there (i know it isn't the right name lol)
Proleller, which isn't used right now.
Forward, Left, Right, Backward animations for moving around.
Death animation is extremely basic.
Reload, the gun arm goes down, and up, and is set to be animated independently from the other parts of the model.
The model is centered inside blender/in the game, so i set the mdltrans to 0 0 0.7 so it doesn't stick half the body underground the geometry.
